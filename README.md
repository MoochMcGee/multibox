multibox
========

A new Bochs-like PC emulator focusing on clean code and functionality.

No 386 emulator has ever had all of the full functionality of a real 386,
or been usable as a reference implementation of a 386 CPU in software.

multibox intends to be an emulator that is capable of this.

Licensing
